## Overview:

This project involves the implementation of a two-dimensional array data structure, commonly referred to as a matrix. The goal is to create a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate data in a grid format, allowing for operations such as retrieving and setting values at specific row and column indices. The project explores various methods of implementing matrices, including the use of generic types to enhance usability and functionality.

Key features of the project include:
- Implementation of basic matrix operations such as `get`, `set`, and `insertCol`.
- Handling of edge cases, including null values and out-of-bounds indices.
- A set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the matrix operations.
